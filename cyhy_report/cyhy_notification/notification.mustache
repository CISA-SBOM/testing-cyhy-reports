{\CISAHeadingThree{New Potentially Risky Services Detected}}
\vspace*{-0.35cm}  % Next line must be blank for proper vertical spacing

Cyber Hygiene scans of your host(s) conducted in the past day have detected new potentially risky services.

These services warrant your attention.  All services are potentially at risk of attack, but some can be more risky when open to the public (e.g. RDP, Telnet, etc.)  CISA recommends validating that each service below is intended to be available to the public and, where applicable, the service is up-to-date on the latest version, correctly configured, and uses strong authentication.
