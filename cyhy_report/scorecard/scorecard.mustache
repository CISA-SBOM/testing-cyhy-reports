\section{Cyber Exposure Rating Methodology}
\label{app:cyber-exposure-rating-methodology}
This section explains how the Cyber Hygiene Scorecard Cyber Exposure ratings were calculated.\\
\\
When vulnerabilities are identified, they are assigned a severity based on an industry-standard scoring model.  The worse the severity is, the more quickly the vulnerability should be remediated.  The most severe vulnerabilities are classified as ``critical'', followed by ``high'', ``medium'' and ``low''.\\
\\
Based on the number of vulnerabilities detected, the severity of those vulnerabilities and how quickly those vulnerabilities are remediated, each organization is assigned a Cyber Exposure rating of ``High'', ``Medium'' or ``Low''.  The specific rules for each rating level are detailed below.\\
\\
For the purposes of this document, the ``time taken to close'' a vulnerability means the amount of time from when the vulnerability was detected by a Cyber Hygiene scan until a follow-up scan confirmed that the vulnerability was no longer detected.

\color{sc-high}High Cyber Exposure \color{black}organizations meet \underline{one or more} of the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0mm, noitemsep]
\item One or more currently-open critical or high vulnerabilities
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the average time taken to close critical vulnerabilities is <<&high_risk_avg_days_to_close_criticals>> days or more
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the maximum time taken to close critical vulnerabilities is <<&high_risk_max_days_to_close_criticals>> days or more
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the average time taken to close high vulnerabilities is <<&high_risk_avg_days_to_close_highs>> days or more
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the maximum time taken to close high vulnerabilities is <<&high_risk_max_days_to_close_highs>> days or more
\end{itemize}

\color{sc-medium}Medium Cyber Exposure \color{black}organizations have no currently-open critical or high vulnerabilities and meet \underline{one or more} of the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0mm, noitemsep]
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the average time taken to close critical vulnerabilities is between <<&med_risk_avg_days_to_close_criticals>>-<<&high_risk_avg_days_to_close_criticals>> days
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the maximum time taken to close critical vulnerabilities is between <<&med_risk_max_days_to_close_criticals>>-<<&high_risk_max_days_to_close_criticals>> days
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the average time taken to close high vulnerabilities is between <<&med_risk_avg_days_to_close_highs>>-<<&high_risk_avg_days_to_close_highs>> days
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the maximum time taken to close high vulnerabilities is between <<&med_risk_max_days_to_close_highs>>-<<&high_risk_max_days_to_close_highs>> days
\item One or more currently-open medium vulnerabilities has been open for <<&med_risk_max_days_currently_open_mediums>> days or more
\end{itemize}

\color{sc-low}Low Cyber Exposure \color{black}organizations meet \underline{all} of the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0mm, noitemsep]
\item Zero currently-open critical or high vulnerabilities
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the average time taken to close critical vulnerabilities is less than <<&med_risk_avg_days_to_close_criticals>> days
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the maximum time taken to close critical vulnerabilities is less than <<&med_risk_max_days_to_close_criticals>> days
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the average time taken to close high vulnerabilities is less than <<&med_risk_avg_days_to_close_highs>> days
\item Over the past <<&closed_tickets_months>> months, the maximum time taken to close high vulnerabilities is less than <<&med_risk_max_days_to_close_highs>> days
\end{itemize}

\color{black}
An organization is considered to be ``Not Scanned'' if none of their addresses have been scanned in the past <<&currently_scanned_days>> days.\\
