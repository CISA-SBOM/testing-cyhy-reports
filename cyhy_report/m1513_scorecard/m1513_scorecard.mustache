\section{Executive Summary}

\large
HTTP connections create a communications integrity and privacy vulnerability which exposes potentially sensitive information about users of unencrypted federal websites and services. Data sent over HTTP is susceptible to interception, manipulation, and impersonation.\\~\\
In June 2015, the White House Office of Management and Budget issued memorandum M-15-13, “\textit{A Policy to Require Secure Connections across Federal Websites and Web Services}”{\small[\href{https://https.cio.gov}{https.cio.gov}]}. This policy requires that federal agencies make all existing websites and services accessible through a secure connection (HTTPS-only, with HTTP Strict Transport Security [HSTS]) \textbf{by December 31, 2016.} \\~\\
This weekly report, created by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is intended to assist federal agencies in the identification of publicly-accessible sites and services that are not currently in compliance with M-15-13 and pinpoint the next steps each domain must take to become compliant. \textbf{This report also encourages agencies to "preload" their domains}\\ {\small\lbrack\href{https://https.cio.gov/hsts/#hsts-preloading}{https.cio.gov/hsts/\#hsts-preloading}]} to better enforce the protections M-15-13 requires.\\

We measure the presence and enforcement of HTTPS for your agency’s publicly-accessible .gov domains. \textbf{This report includes all agency-registered domains and known subdomains} (see the Methodology section for a description of how these domains are collected). Domains which do nothing but redirect to other websites \textit{are} measured.\\~\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{<<domain_supports_https_count>>} domains (<<uses_https_percentage>>\%) have HTTPS enabled
	\item \textbf{<<domain_enforces_https_count>>} domains (<<enforces_https_percentage>>\%) default to HTTPS
	\item \textbf{<<domain_uses_strong_hsts_count>>} domains (<<hsts_percentage>>\%) use HSTS
	\item \textbf{<<m1513_count>>} domains compliant with M-15-13
\end{itemize}

\RaggedRight


<<&agency>> owns <<base_domain_count>> second-level .gov domains and CISA discovered <<subdomain_count>> subdomains. \textbf{Of these, <<eligible_domains_count>> second-level domains and <<eligible_subdomains_count>> subdomains responded to HTTP/HTTPS requests over the public Internet}. Domains that did not respond to these requests are marked 'non-web' and are removed from the above compliance figures. See the Results section for a list of non-web domains.

Each public website or web service an agency operates \textbf{must}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide service over HTTPS.
	\item Automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, or disable HTTP entirely.
	\item Have an HSTS policy in place. This can take one of two approaches:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\normalsize{
		\item The parent domain (e.g. https://agency.gov) has an HSTS policy that includes subdomains and has a max-age of at least 1 year. Including subdomains means that subdomains that are used for intranet sites must also support HTTPS.
		\item The parent domain and each of its publicly-reachable subdomains must individually set an HSTS policy with a max-age of at least 1 year.
		}
	\end{enumerate}
\large
Under either approach, web services used by non-browser clients (e.g. APIs) must still individually enforce HTTPS, as HSTS is not supported by non-browser clients.
\end{itemize}
M-15-13 includes \textbf{all domains and subdomains that are publicly reachable over HTTP/HTTPS}, regardless of whether those domains are in practice only used internally.\\~\\

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) maintains an M-15-13 implementation guide and FAQ, which can be found at \href{https://https.cio.gov/guide}{https.cio.gov/guide}.\\~\\

\textbf{\color{dhs-dark-gray}{\Large{What else should I do?}}}\\~\\


<<&agency>> should consider adding its domains to the 'HSTS preload list'.\\~\\

For a user to take advantage of HSTS, their browser does have to see the HSTS header at least once. This means that users are not protected until after their first successful secure connection to a given domain.\\~\\

In addition, in many cases, there may never be a first visit to \texttt{https://domain.gov}. For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Many federal websites redirect directly from \texttt{http://domain.gov} to \texttt{https://www.domain.gov}.
	\item Many federal domains that are used solely for redirects will redirect from \texttt{http://source.gov} directly to \texttt{https://destination.gov}.
\end{itemize}
In these cases, \texttt{https://domain.gov} and \texttt{https://source.gov} are never visited, meaning connecting clients will never see an HSTS policy with an \texttt{includeSubDomains} directive that applies to the whole zone.\\~\\

To solve this problem, the Chrome security team created an 'HSTS preload list': a list of domains baked into Chrome that get Strict Transport Security enabled automatically, even for the first visit. Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge also incorporate Chrome’s HSTS preload list, making this feature shared across major browsers.\\~\\

%M-15-13 requires HTTPS be served and that an HSTS policy is in force. However, in order for a user to take advantage of the protection HSTS provides, their browser has to see the HSTS header at least once. This means that users are not protected until after their first successful secure connection to a given domain. This presents an opportunity for an attacker to capture information about the visitor (such as cookies from a previous secure session) or to maliciously redirect the user to a phishing site.\\~\\

%To solve the “first visit” problem, Google created an 'HSTS preload list'. This list, which gets incorporated directly into most modern browsers, consists of those domains that have Strict Transport Security enabled automatically, even for the first visit. Domains that comply with M-15-13 can better protect their users by adding themselves to the preload list. This requires that a domain take the first approach described above, which includes those where the domain has an HSTS policy of "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload". This necessarily includes those subdomains that are in use solely on intranets.\\~\\

%Preloading takes on even greater importance because, in many cases, there may never be a first visit. For an HSTS policy that includes subdomains to take effect without preloading, the user must connect ("200 OK") to \textbf{https}://domain.gov (as the HSTS header is not cached by browsers unless there is a valid secure connection). Even if a user types ‘domain.gov’ by hand, many Federal websites redirect from http://domain.gov to the ‘www’ subdomain, leaving https://domain.gov unvisited. “Vanity domains” or domains used solely for redirects {\it that don’t first redirect to the secure versions of themselves also are never visited over HTTPS} and thus an HSTS policy that includes subdomains will not be successfully set with connecting clients.\\~\\

A description of how to preload a domain can be found at \href{https://https.cio.gov/hsts/#how-to-preload-a-domain}{https.cio.gov/hsts/\#how-to-preload-a-domain}.\\~\\%~\\ <--removed and omitted the linebreak

This report measures the presence and enforcement of HTTPS for <<&agency>>’s\\ publicly-accessible domains and subdomains. Domains which do nothing but redirect to other websites \textit{are} measured.\\~\\

Each domain and subdomain is assessed on four “endpoints”:\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{http://\hspace{5em}}2. \textbf{http://www\hspace{5em}}3. \textbf{https://\hspace{5em}}4. \textbf{https://www}
\end{enumerate}

Data from these endpoints is used to characterize the overall behavior of a domain. These measurements are performed using \texttt{pshtt}, our open source HTTPS scanner {\small\lbrack\href{https://github.com/cisagov/pshtt}{https://github.com/cisagov/pshtt}]}. All owned .gov domains {\small\lbrack\href{https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/blob/main/current-federal.csv}{https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/blob/main/current-federal.csv}]} and known subdomains are included. Subdomains are gathered from the following sources:

Our scans use the Mozilla CA Certificate Store {\small\lbrack\href{https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs}{https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs}]}. This trust store most accurately represents what roots are “publicly trusted”, and is used in Firefox, Android, Linux, and many commercial and open source network security tools. Note that the Federal Common Policy CA, the Federal trust anchor, is not currently trusted by the Mozilla CA Certificate Store. The Federal Public Key Infrastructure Policy Authority (FPKI PA) estimates it will be included by 2019.\\~\\

M-15-13 has no restrictions on acceptable certificate authorities agencies might use to meet the requirements of M-15-13. However, Federally issued certificates will not be practical for web services whose users may not always be expected to trust the issuing federal certificate authority. OMB's Compliance Guide at \href{https://https.cio.gov}{https.cio.gov} answers the following questions in detail:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://https.cio.gov/certificates/#does-the-us-government-operate-a-publicly-trusted-certificate-authority\%3f}{Does the US government operate a publicly trusted certificate authority?}

The following table shows where each <<&agency>> domain falls along the spectrum of M-15-13 compliance and whether the domain is preloaded. To be M-15-13 compliant, a domain must be “Yes” for 'Uses HTTPS', 'Enforces HTTPS', and 'HSTS'. Definitions of the field values follow the table.\\~\\

M-15-13 includes \textbf{all domains and subdomains that are publicly reachable over HTTP/HTTPS}, regardless of whether those domains are in practice only used internally.\\~\\

Subdomains of domains that are HSTS preloaded are not shown below; preloading ensures those domains' compliance with M-15-13. All known subdomains are included in the attachment\\ \texttt{pshtt-results.csv}.\\~\\
%Note that if a parent domain uses \texttt{includeSubDomains} as part of its HSTS policy, subdomains with a score or “No” for 'HSTS' may be in compliance.

Each domain's score is calculated from values derived from a \texttt{pshtt} scan; see the \href{https://github.com/cisagov/pshtt/#whats-checked}{README} for definitions of the values in the tool's output. \\~\\

Whether a site can be used over HTTPS, on either its bare domain or its www subdomain. Sites that appear to redirect “down” from HTTPS to HTTP are considered a “No”. Domains with “Bad chain” or “Expired certificate” are considered a “Yes” for count purposes, but warnings are likely to be presented to many users.
\begin{itemize}
	\item “Bad chain” indicates that either (1) a “chain” of intermediate certificates are missing that would provide the connecting client enough information to connect the certificate to a trusted root certificate, or (2) that the server certificate chains to root that is not in the user’s root store. Our scans use the Mozilla root store {\small\lbrack\href{https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs}{https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs}]}.
	\item “Bad hostname” indicates there is a mismatch between the domain in question and the domains listed on a certificate’s Common Name field and/or Subject Alternative Name extension.
	\item “Expired certificate” is the value for certificates that have a “Not Valid After” date before the date of our scan.\\
\end{itemize}

In \texttt{pshtt}, "Uses HTTPS" is mapped to the value for 'Domain Supports HTTPS'. It is calculated:
\begin{center}
\normalsize\textit{((Valid HTTPS == “True” AND Downgrades HTTPS == “False”) OR \\
(Bad Hostname == “False” AND Bad Chain == “True” and Downgrades HTTPS == “False”))}\\
\end{center}

\phantomsection % links this section from toc
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Enforces HTTPS}% Adds subsection to toc
\hypertarget{Enforces HTTPS}{\textbf{\color{dhs-dark-gray}{\large{Enforces HTTPS}}}}\\
\textit{Values: Yes, No (blank)}\\~\\

Whether a domain appears to “default” to using HTTPS (a domain must be a “Yes” for 'Uses HTTPS' to qualify). A domain where 'Redirect' is false is allowed to eventually redirect to an https:// URI. A domain where 'Redirect' is true must immediately redirect clients to an https:// URI (even if that URI is on another domain).\\~\\

In \texttt{pshtt}, "Enforces HTTPS" is mapped to the value for 'Domain Enforces HTTPS'. It is calculated:
\begin{center}
\normalsize\textit{(Domain Supports HTTPS == “True” AND\\
(Strictly Forces HTTPS == “True” AND (Defaults to HTTPS == “True” OR Redirect == “True”) OR\\
(Strictly Forces HTTPS == “False” AND Defaults to HTTPS == “True”)))}\\
\end{center}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Strict Transport Security (HSTS)}% Adds subsection to toc
\hypertarget{Strict Transport Security (HSTS)}{\textbf{\color{dhs-dark-gray}{\large{Strict Transport Security (HSTS)}}}}\\
\textit{Values: Yes, No (blank), 'Yes, but low max age'}\\~\\

Whether a domain has implemented HTTP Strict Transport Security {\small\lbrack\href{https://https.cio.gov/hsts}{https.cio.gov/hsts}]}. HSTS is an HTTP response header that directs supporting browsers {\small\lbrack\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security#Browser_support}{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP\_Strict\_Transport\_Security\#Browser\_support}]} to, after the first visit, only communicate with a domain over HTTPS for the duration of \texttt{max-age} (even if the user clicks or types a plain HTTP link).\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item "Yes" means that a valid Strict-Transport-Security header with at least \texttt{max-age=31536000} (1 year) is present on the domain's default endpoint. (For increased security, you should consider the full HSTS preloading of the parent domain, which includes all subdomains.)
	\item “Yes, but low max-age” means that a valid Strict-Transport-Security header is present, but the \texttt{max-age} is below 31536000 as required by M-15-13.
\end{itemize}

In \texttt{pshtt}, "Strict Transport Security (HSTS)" is mapped to the value for 'Domain Uses Strong HSTS'. It is calculated:
\begin{center}
\normalsize\textit{HSTS == “True” AND HSTS Max Age >= 31536000}\\
\end{center}

\phantomsection % links this section from toc
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{M-15-13}% Adds subsection to toc
\hypertarget{M-15-13}{\textbf{\color{dhs-dark-gray}{\large{M-15-13}}}}\\
\textit{Values: \checkmark (compliant), \xmark (non-compliant)}\\~\\

Whether a domain is "Yes" for 'Uses HTTPS', 'Enforces HTTPS', and 'HSTS'. See section 2, Guidance, “What does M-15-13 require?”.\\~\\

In \texttt{pshtt}, M-15-13 compliance is met when:
\begin{center}
\normalsize\textit{Domain Supports HTTPS == “True” AND Domain Enforces HTTPS == “True” AND Domain Uses Strong HSTS == “True”}\\
\end{center}

% A subdomain can receive a score of “No” for HSTS and yet be M-15-13 compliant. In these cases, the subdomain inherits the HSTS policy from the parent domain.
% TODO ^ fix this in Python!, maybe a new value that says "parent"
% Nevermind! This only matters if a domain is preloaded, since the parent domain won't be loaded unless preloading is in effect.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Preloaded}% Adds subsection to toc
\hypertarget{Preloaded}{\textbf{\color{dhs-dark-gray}{\large{Preloaded}}}}\\
\textit{Values: \checkmark (yes), \xmark (no), "Preload-ready"}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \checkmark indicates that a domain is visibly preload-ready (\texttt{preload} is indicated in the HSTS header) and that the domain is actually in the public versioned Chrome preload list\\ {\small\lbrack\href{https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json}{chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport\_security\_state\_static.json}]}. Reaching this step effectively means that a domain's namespace is permanently and fully committed to HTTPS.
	\item “Preload-ready” indicates the domain meets the submission requirements for preloading, as outlined at the HSTS Preload List site {\small\lbrack\href{https://hstspreload.appspot.com}{hstspreload.appspot.com}]}, but is not in the public versioned Chrome preload list. Be aware that “preload-ready” domains can be submitted \textit{by anyone at any time} to the HSTS Preload List site. This submission could potentially have negative effects if you have intranet subdomains that do not support HTTPS. The \texttt{includeSubDomains} directive in the HSTS header will, when preloaded, direct browsers to enforce HTTPS. Because HSTS disables the capability to click through security warnings, these subdomains will effectively be inaccessible to your users. If your domain is not ready to be preloaded, you should consider removing the \texttt{preload} directive in the HSTS header.
